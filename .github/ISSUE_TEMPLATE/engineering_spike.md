## Topic
Thing you are exploring/researching

## Background
Brief description of the purpose and goal of this spike that provides enough of the recent history to show what led to this spike. Try to stick to the facts of the situation—beliefs/assumptions go in the Hypothesis section).

## Hypothesis
List any relevant hypotheses relevant to this research spike.

**Problem Hypothesis:**  
We believe `state the problem identified` based on `state the supporting data`.

**Solution Hypothesis:**  
By `state proposed solution`, we believe `user behavior change`, solving `user problem`.

**Objective**  
What are we hoping to achieve with this research spike? How does learning about this contribute to our team’s goals and to end users? Some sample prompts below.

```
Understanding this topic better will allow us to __________ .
The value of reducing uncertainty here is __________.
Our goal at the end of this research spike is to be able to __________.
The benefit to users (CDC or STLTs) is __________.
```

## Questions
Progress towards reducing uncertainty here will look like answering these questions:

- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]
- [Question 3]

## Acceptance Criteria
Please write up a spike doc and save it to the drive and present the findings either in slack or as a techtalk in the dev sync meeting.

This value has been subtracted from the patient's displayed TB and Mitogen results. Lower than expected results with the Mitogen tube present false-negative Quantiferon readings by detecting a patient with a potential immune supressive condition and/or suboptimal pre-analytical specimen handling. The TB1 Antigen tube is coated with a M.tuberculosis-specific antigen designed to elicit responses from TB antigen primed CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes. The TB2 antigen tube is coated with M. tuberculosis-specific antigens designed to elicit responses from TB antigen primed CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes., THIS TEST WAS PERFORMED AT: QUEST DIAGNOSIS LLC 200 FOREST STREET MARLBOROUGH, MA 01752-3023"
